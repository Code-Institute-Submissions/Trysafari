 Troubleshootings 
-------------------
- we discovered that the navigation bar tool was not working so i had to use a navbar instead of the menubar buttons. Used theBootstarp dropdown bars and researched how to create navbars in youtube
- All users should be able to access easily through the pages with no delays , as defined on the site.
- After creating the pages should be accessible and be displayed in both the desktop and by phone. should checking that all the pages are responsively active
- Some of the images were pixilated  i was able to access good images in the free stock photos at the pexels site https://www.pexels.com/ 
- Some of the images sizes were too big so i used picresize webpage https://picresize.com/# to resize the images that would suite the site according to the users preference
